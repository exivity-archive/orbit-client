# Getting Started

## Installation
1. Install the package:
<Preview>
  yarn add orbit-client
</Preview>

## Configuration
1. Create occonfig.json in the root of your project:
<Preview>
  { schema }
</Preview>

2. Run orbit-client command to create components:
<Preview>
  yarn orbit-client
</Preview>
<br/>
Note: We use pluralize package to pluralize schema models to Collection component names. If this happens
incorrectly you can use the plural prop to correct this.

3. Set up a provider to provide orbit-client with your own crud functions:
<Preview>
 { crudProvider }
</Preview>
<br/>
Note: Orbit-client uses these functions to query sources other than the cache/memory. We use
react-orbitjs for querying the cache. You can configure components to only make use of cache or to skip the cache. Learn more about
this at the <Link to='advanced-usage#cache-modes'>advanced usage</Link> section.

## Basic usage
Thats it, you are set to go! Now you can use the components from your previously specified
target directory.

### Record
<Preview>
 { record }
</Preview>

<Playground>
  <Planet id='earth' cache='only'>
    {(client) => <Display name='client' object={client}/> }
  </Planet>
</Playground>

### Collection
<Preview>
 { collection }
</Preview>

<Playground>
  <Planets cache='only'>
    {(client) => <Display name='client' object={client}/> }
  </Planets>
</Playground>
